## Research Instructions for Claude Agent

### Phase 1: Source-First Research
1. **Search priority newsletters FIRST** before general web search
2. Use site-specific searches: `site:jasonleow.substack.com [topic]`
3. Check the last 30 days of content from these sources
4. Look for first-person experiences and case studies, not generic advice

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis
5. Identify what these sources are NOT covering about your topic
6. Note the angles they're taking—find opportunities to:
   - Challenge conventional wisdom they're repeating
   - Dig deeper into surface-level coverage
   - Connect dots they haven't connected
   - Share practical details they glossed over

### Phase 3: Trend Detection
7. Track recurring themes across multiple newsletters
8. Note disagreements between sources—these reveal nuance
9. Identify emerging terminology or frameworks being coined
10. Look for "building in public" updates with real numbers/data

### Phase 4: Differentiation Strategy
11. Find the unique angle NO ONE else is covering
12. Prioritize:
    - Personal stories over generic advice
    - Specific numbers over vague claims
    - Contrarian takes backed by evidence
    - Practical "how I did it" over theoretical "how to"
13. Ask: "What would make someone share this specific article?"

### Phase 5: Broader Research
14. Only AFTER exhausting priority sources, expand to:
    - General web search for data/statistics
    - Academic sources for research backing
    - Mainstream news for context/timeliness
15. Cross-reference findings with priority source perspectives

### Quality Filters
- **Reject**: Listicles, generic advice, obvious SEO content
- **Prioritize**: Personal experiments, transparent failures, specific metrics
- **Look for**: Writers who show their work and admit uncertainty
- **Avoid**: Content that could apply to anyone (not specific enough)

### Output Requirements
When presenting research findings:
1. Cite specific newsletters/sources by name
2. Include direct quotes when they're exceptional
3. Note publication dates for timeliness
4. Highlight contrarian or surprising findings
5. Identify gaps where original research is needed
6. Suggest specific angles that haven't been covered
