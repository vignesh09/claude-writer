### 2026-02-04 - The Certainty Tax: Why the Best Strategy Is to Stop Predicting

- **Research**: `research-brief-uncertainty-inequality-future-trends-2026-02-03.md`
- **Article**: `article-certainty-tax-uncertain-future-2026-02-03.md`
- **LinkedIn**: `linkedin-certainty-tax-uncertain-future-2026-02-03.md`
- **Newsletter**: `newsletter-certainty-tax-uncertain-future-2026-02-03.md`
- **Social**: `social-certainty-tax-uncertain-future-2026-02-03.md`
- **Key Insight**: The certainty tax is the premium paid for stability that no longer exists. Predictions fail systematically (economists accurate only 3 months out, truck driving automation missed by 6+ years). Barbell strategy + optionality over optimization = antifragile positioning. Paradox: AI may reduce wage inequality while increasing wealth inequality—lower-skilled workers gain productivity but high-income workers capture capital returns. The inheritance divide creates millennial aristocracy vs. permanent renter class within same generation. Stop paying certainty tax, build systems that work regardless of what happens.

### 2026-01-27 - Building a Content Creation Framework with Claude Code

- **LinkedIn Article**: `linkedin-building-content-framework-2026-01-21.md`
- **Platforms**: LinkedIn article only (meta-content documenting the system itself)
- **No research brief**: This is first-person documentation, not researched content
- **Key Insight**: The best systems eliminate decisions, not just tasks. Content creation difficulty isn't about publishing—it's about making 47 micro-decisions before starting. The framework removes decision fatigue by automating: theme extraction, research deduplication, platform optimization, and archival tracking. Real impact: 3-4 posts per quarter → 3 articles with 4 platform versions in one week.

### 2026-01-27 - Understanding Aerospace Engine Design Through Storytelling

- **Research**: `research-brief-aerospace-engine-design-principles-2026-01-21.md`
- **Article**: `article-aerospace-engine-design-principles-2026-01-21.md`
- **Platforms**: Article only (no LinkedIn/newsletter/social versions)
- **Key Insight**: Every aerospace engine—from the Wright Flyer to Mars rockets—works on the same principle as a fire extinguisher on a skateboard: Newton's Third Law. The fire extinguisher demonstration makes jet engines, ramjets, and scramjets accessible to non-engineers through storytelling rather than equations.

### 2026-01-27 - The IT Worker's Farm Fantasy: When Burnout Meets Economic Reality

- **Research**: `research-brief-it-workers-farm-fantasy-2026-01-25.md`
- **Article**: `article-it-workers-farm-fantasy-2026-01-25.md`
- **LinkedIn**: `linkedin-it-workers-farm-fantasy-2026-01-25.md`
- **Newsletter**: `newsletter-it-workers-farm-fantasy-2026-01-25.md`
- **Social**: `social-it-workers-farm-fantasy-2026-01-25.md`
- **Key Insight**: The farm fantasy plaguing 83% of burned-out Indian IT workers is Grass is Greener Syndrome—a geographic solution to a boundary-setting problem. Tier-2 cities offer 80% of lifestyle benefits with 20% of the risk, but aren't Instagram-worthy. The 889% farmland appreciation reveals how desperate people are to buy permission to rest rather than set boundaries today.

### 2026-01-21 - The Overlooked Basics of Behavior Change

- **Research**: `research-brief-overlooked-behavior-change-basics-2026-01-21.md`
- **Article**: `article-overlooked-behavior-change-basics-2026-01-21.md`
- **LinkedIn**: `linkedin-overlooked-behavior-change-basics-2026-01-21.md`
- **Newsletter**: `newsletter-overlooked-behavior-change-basics-2026-01-21.md`
- **Social**: `social-overlooked-behavior-change-basics-2026-01-21.md`
- **Key Insight**: The simplest behavior change strategies (environment design, friction removal, implementation intentions) have the strongest evidence base but are dismissed as "too basic." The 8% who succeed execute boring fundamentals while the 92% search for complex systems.

### 2026-01-20 - The Goal Achievement Paradox: Why Setting Goals Sabotages Success

- **Research**: `research-brief-goal-achievement-paradox-2026-01-17.md`
- **Article**: `article-goal-achievement-paradox-2026-01-20.md`
- **LinkedIn**: `linkedin-goal-achievement-paradox-2026-01-20.md`
- **Newsletter**: `newsletter-goal-achievement-paradox-2026-01-20.md`
- **Social**: `social-goal-achievement-paradox-2026-01-20.md`
- **Key Insight**: Goal-setting triggers cognitive dissonance and threat responses that cause the 92% failure rate. Identity-based habits + environment design + implementation intentions bypass the goal psychology entirely.

### 2026-01-15 - Happiness Isn't the Reward. It's the Fuel.
