# LinkedIn Post: Happiness and Self-Control

---

## LINKEDIN POST:

I used to believe discipline came first, happiness later.

Grind now. Feel good eventually. Earn the reward.

Turns out, I had the causation backwards.

A 2024 study tracked 1,600+ working adults over a year. The assumption going in was obvious: self-control leads to happiness. Discipline creates achievement, achievement creates satisfaction.

The data showed the opposite.

People who felt better at one point showed better self-control months later. But exercising discipline didn't predict becoming happier.

Happiness predicted discipline. Not the other way around.

Here's the twist that made it click for me:

Another study found that *trying* to be happy depletes willpower. Pursuing happiness as a goal drains the same resources you need for self-control.

The distinction matters:
- Experiencing well-being enhances your capacity
- Chasing happiness depletes it

Maybe the question isn't "How do I build more willpower?"

Maybe it's "What would help me feel well enough that discipline comes easier?"

Those are different questions. They lead to different approaches.

What's something that genuinely improves your well-being - not because you should do it, but because you actually enjoy it?
