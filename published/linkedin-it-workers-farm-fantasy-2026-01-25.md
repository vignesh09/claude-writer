## LINKEDIN POST:

83% of Indian IT workers are burned out.

And most of them are solving it the wrong way.

I keep hearing the same fantasy: "I'm thinking about buying a farmhouse. Just... stepping away from all of this."

I get it. I've had that exact thought.

Here's what surprised me when I looked at the data:

The average IT salary is 6-7x higher than farm income. Only 3.8% of rural homes have fiber internet. Healthcare infrastructure is "rudimentary" in most villages.

But the real problem?

Psychologists call it GIGS (Grass is Greener Syndrome)—using geographic solutions for psychological problems.

The inability to set work boundaries in Bangalore doesn't disappear when you move to Thally.

If you can't say no to 70-hour weeks now, what changes on a farm?

The uncomfortable truth: buying a farmhouse for 50 lakh feels easier than saying "no" to your manager tomorrow.

Meanwhile, Tier-2 cities offer 80% of the lifestyle benefits with 20% of the risk. Lower costs. Better air. Established infrastructure. Career intact.

Before investing lakhs in land, try investing in boundaries.

The farm will still be there if that doesn't work.

What's the real problem you're trying to solve—and is geography actually the answer?

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:

- **Optimal posting time**: Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-9 AM IST (professionals checking LinkedIn before work)
- **First-hour response plan**: Engage thoughtfully with early commenters, especially those sharing their own farm fantasies or boundary-setting struggles. Ask follow-up questions to deepen discussion.
- **Expected engagement**: Mix of validation ("I feel this"), pushback from farmland enthusiasts, and requests for Tier-2 city recommendations
- **Follow-up content**: Could post about specific Tier-2 city comparisons or boundary-setting scripts that actually worked

---

## PERFORMANCE METRICS TO TRACK:

- **Target engagement rate**: 3-5% (comments + shares relative to impressions)
- **Target reach**: 5-10x follower count
- **Quality indicators**: Comment depth (are people sharing personal stories?), saves, DMs asking for more details, shares with added commentary
