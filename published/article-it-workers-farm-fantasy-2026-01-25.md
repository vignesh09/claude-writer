Every third conversation in Bangalore seems to end the same way lately.

Someone mentions their workload. The 70-hour weeks. The back-to-back meetings. The Sunday emails that somehow demand Monday morning responses. And then, inevitably, the fantasy arrives: "I'm thinking about buying a farmhouse. Just... stepping away from all of this."

I get it. I've had that exact thought.

The image is seductive: morning coffee watching the sunrise over your own land. Organic vegetables. Clean air. No Slack notifications. No sprint planning. Just peace.

Here's what surprised me when I actually looked at the numbers behind this fantasy: **The math doesn't work. The infrastructure doesn't work. And most revealing—the psychology shows us something uncomfortable about why we're all having this same dream.**

## The Burnout Numbers Are Real

Let me start by acknowledging what makes this fantasy so compelling in the first place.

**83% of Indian IT workers report burnout symptoms.** Not stress. Not "busy." Burnout—the clinical kind that comes with emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.

One in four IT workers logs over 70 hours weekly. That's 10-hour days, six days a week, as the baseline. Not during crunch time. Every week.

In the last year, India's top IT companies—TCS, Infosys, Wipro—laid off over 60,000 employees in what they're calling "strategic realignment." Meanwhile, analysts estimate AI threatens another 500,000 jobs in the Indian IT outsourcing sector within three years.

The managed farmland industry saw these numbers and built a business model.

Farmland prices around Bangalore range from ₹50 lakh to ₹2 crore per acre. In areas specifically targeting IT professionals like Thally (near Electronic City), plots sell for ₹25-55 lakh per acre. One marketing site documented appreciation from ₹45 per square foot in 2020 to ₹445 per square foot in 2025—an **889% increase in five years**.

The marketing language isn't subtle: "peace and quiet," "urban exodus," "cleaner air and higher standard of living." They're not selling farmland. They're selling an escape fantasy to people who desperately need one.

And here's what made me pause: What if that escape fantasy is actually preventing people from solving their real problem?

## The Income Math Nobody Talks About

Let's do the calculation that most weekend farmland browsers skip.

The average software engineer in India earns ₹7-8.6 lakh annually. That's ₹60,000-72,000 per month.

The average income for someone engaged in traditional farming? ₹1.2 lakh annually. That's ₹10,000 per month total—and when you isolate just farm income, it drops to ₹27 per day.

**That's a 6-7x income reduction.**

"But I wouldn't do traditional farming," you might think. "I'd do organic. Value-added products. Agritourism."

Fair. Let's look at the success stories.

The articles celebrating IT professionals who "made it" in agriculture reveal a pattern: Deesan Farms was started by an IT couple who transformed their family's existing 36-acre farm using modern technology and organic methods. SumArth was founded by an engineer who now supports 25,000 farmers across 500 villages, with collective earnings surpassing ₹100 crore. Sonia used her biotechnology background to create a high-tech mushroom farm producing 10 tonnes monthly.

These aren't burned-out developers who bought a weekend plot and started planting tomatoes. These are **agripreneurs with significant capital, existing family land, or professional agricultural training** who built agriculture-focused businesses.

There's a conspicuous absence in all this coverage: the story of an IT worker who quit their ₹12 lakh job, bought farmland with their savings, and now makes a comparable income through full-time farming while maintaining their previous quality of life.

That person either doesn't exist or isn't sharing their story.

More than half of India's farmers are currently in debt. The government set a goal to double farmers' income and fell short by 25%. This isn't because farmers aren't working hard—it's because agriculture in India faces structural economic challenges that romantic Instagram aesthetics can't solve.

## The Infrastructure Reality Check

Here's where the fantasy collides with logistics.

**Internet connectivity**: Only 3.8% of rural households have fiber optic connections, compared to 15.3% in urban areas. One in six rural homes remains completely disconnected. Power outages and load shedding are daily occurrences.

"I'll work remotely from the farm," people say.

With what internet? IT work requires stable, high-speed connections for video calls, consistent power for 8-10 hour workdays, and backup options when the primary connection fails. Rural infrastructure currently cannot reliably support this.

**Healthcare**: Bangalore offers 24-hour emergency services, multi-organ transplant facilities, and specialists in 30+ fields within a 15-30 minute drive for most areas. Rural villages, per migration studies, have "only rudimentary health infrastructure" and lack "proper hospitals with ventilators."

The critical question nobody asks in the farmland marketing materials: What happens when your child has a medical emergency at night on a farm 80 kilometers from the city?

**Education**: Quality schooling exists in semi-rural areas around Bangalore, but families must choose between boarding schools (₹6-10 lakh annually for top-tier options), significant daily commutes, or compromises on curriculum and educational quality. This is often the silent veto for families with school-age children—the thing that kills the fantasy without anyone admitting it out loud.

The managed farmland industry markets to "young families and professionals" looking for weekend getaways. Note the phrasing: *weekend* getaways. Not full-time migration. The industry knows what the buyers eventually discover—that maintaining a Bangalore base is necessary for career, income, infrastructure, and family needs.

## The Pattern Nobody's Naming

This is where the research into what psychologists call "Grass is Greener Syndrome" (GIGS) gets uncomfortable.

GIGS is a psychological phenomenon where individuals constantly compare their current situation with the belief that something better exists elsewhere. It's characterized by escape fantasies, impulsive decision-making around major life changes, and—most relevant here—using geographic solutions to solve internal psychological problems.

The clinical literature describes people with GIGS as having difficulty trusting their own decision-making because they've repeatedly tried to "escape" situations only to find themselves facing similar problems in new locations. Their instinct when overwhelmed is to impulsively leave rather than address underlying patterns.

Sound familiar?

Here's what made me reconsider my own farm fantasy: **The inability to set work boundaries in Bangalore doesn't magically disappear when you move to Thally.** If you can't say no to 70-hour weeks now, what makes you think you'll maintain those boundaries while simultaneously managing farm operations, dealing with agricultural labor, learning cultivation practices, and trying to make the income math work?

The farm fantasy offers permission to rest—but you could grant yourself that permission today. In your current job. In your current city.

The fantasy lets you avoid the uncomfortable truth: you need to have hard conversations with your manager about workload. You need to stop responding to emails on Sunday. You need to potentially change jobs or companies. You might need to accept a career plateau in exchange for sustainable work hours.

Those conversations are difficult. They require advocating for yourself in a culture that often punishes boundary-setting. They risk disappointing people or losing opportunities.

Buying a farmhouse plot for ₹50 lakh feels easier than saying "no" to your manager tomorrow.

## The Evidence-Based Alternative Nobody Instagram's

While researching this piece, I found data that barely appears in the "escape to farm" narrative.

**Tier-2 cities experienced 50%+ year-over-year growth in IT hiring** in 2025, compared to 12-15% in Tier-1 cities. Sixty percent of India's tech workforce now operates remotely or in hybrid models. Fifteen percent of India's tech talent has already moved to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

The cost advantages are substantial: hiring is 25-30% cheaper than metros, real estate and operational costs are up to 50% lower. Rent in cities like Udaipur runs ₹5,000-10,000 monthly—comparable to rural areas but with established internet, healthcare, schools, and co-working spaces. Employee attrition in Tier-2 cities with strong learning and development programs sits below 10%.

**Cities like Indore, Jaipur, Coimbatore, Pune, and Chandigarh offer 80% of the lifestyle benefits of rural areas with 20% of the infrastructure risk.**

Lower cost of living. Less traffic. Better air quality than Bangalore. Closer to nature. Slower pace. All while maintaining your IT career trajectory, your income, your family's access to education and healthcare, and your professional network.

But here's why this doesn't dominate the conversation: it's not Instagram-worthy.

A weekend photo of your managed farmland with sunrise and organic vegetables gets 200 likes and comments saying "goals!" A photo of your apartment in Indore gets "oh, that's nice."

The farm fantasy offers a narrative of radical life transformation. Tier-2 cities offer practical problem-solving. Our brains prefer the dramatic story, even when the practical solution actually works.

## What We're Not Talking About

If every burned-out IT worker's solution is individual escape—whether to farms or to different careers—who's left to fight for fixing the broken system?

Reasonable work hours shouldn't require geographic relocation. Mental health support should be standard. Overtime should be regulated and compensated appropriately. AI-driven transitions should include worker retraining and protection rather than just mass layoffs.

The managed farmland industry is worth billions now partly because it's easier to sell individual escape fantasies than to organize collective action demanding better working conditions.

I'm not saying farmland is a bad investment. I'm not saying nobody should pursue agriculture. And I'm absolutely not dismissing the severity of the burnout crisis—83% is a structural failure, not individual weakness.

What I am saying is this: **the farm fantasy might be a symptom, not a solution.**

It's a culturally acceptable way to fantasize about rest without addressing why you feel you need to leave everything behind to earn that rest. It's a geographic solution to a boundary-setting problem. It's an escape fantasy that lets you avoid confronting your relationship with work, your inability to say no, or your company's toxic culture.

## The Uncomfortable Questions

Here's what I've been asking myself:

Have I actually tried setting firm work boundaries in my current job before planning a geographic escape?

Have I looked at Tier-2 cities that would solve 80% of my problems with 5% of the risk?

Is this about farming, or is it about giving myself permission to rest—permission I could grant today without spending ₹50 lakh?

If I can't say no to Sunday emails in Bangalore, why do I think I'll suddenly have healthy boundaries while managing farmland?

Am I solving a problem or just changing its location?

The research on reverse migration during COVID is revealing. When millions of workers were forced to return to their villages during lockdowns, most couldn't sustain rural livelihoods despite wanting to stay. The infrastructure was "creaky and insufficient." Migrants who returned home had "few alternatives for earning cash," and "their small pieces of land, if they had any, could not sustain them."

Even when people desperately wanted to make it work, economic reality and infrastructure gaps sent them back to cities.

## What Changed My Thinking

I don't have clean answers. I still feel the pull of the farm fantasy when I'm in back-to-back meetings all day.

But here's what shifted for me: I started tracking how often I actually enforce boundaries versus how often I fantasize about circumstances where boundaries wouldn't be necessary.

Last month, I said no to a Sunday meeting. It felt terrible. My manager was disappointed. I worried about career consequences. But the meeting got rescheduled, the work still happened, and I had Sunday with my family.

That "no" cost me nothing except temporary discomfort.

The farm plot I was browsing costs ₹65 lakh, requires 2-hour weekend commutes, and—based on the data—would likely remain a weekend retreat while I maintain my Bangalore base and income anyway.

One of those solves my problem. The other lets me avoid it while feeling productive about "planning my future."

I started asking friends who bought farmland how often they actually visit. Year one: almost every weekend. Year two: once a month. Year three: "We really should go more often."

The fantasy fades when it collides with reality—commute times, maintenance issues, the pull of familiar conveniences, and the realization that the burnout came with them to the farm because it was never about the location.

## The Real Question

What if the problem isn't where you live—it's that you've never learned to protect your time and energy in the place you are?

What if the 889% appreciation in farmland prices over five years is less about land value and more about how desperate people are to buy permission to rest?

What if the most radical thing you could do isn't buying a farm—it's setting work hours you actually maintain, taking your vacation days, and saying "no" when you're at capacity?

Tier-2 cities offer the rational middle ground with data proving it works. Boundary-setting offers the psychological solution that travels with you anywhere.

The farm fantasy offers an escape that, for most people considering it, will remain exactly that: a fantasy. A expensive, beautiful, Instagram-worthy symptom of a problem they're not addressing.

I'm not here to tell you what to choose. But I am suggesting: before you invest lakhs in land, invest in learning to set boundaries. Before you plan a geographic escape, try saying no to the next unnecessary meeting.

The farm will still be there if that doesn't work.

But you might be surprised by what changes when you finally give yourself permission to rest without requiring a 60-kilometer commute and a massive life upheaval first.

*The managed farmland industry will continue growing as long as burnout remains at 83%. The question isn't whether people should buy farmland—it's whether they're using it to solve their actual problem or just buying a prettier backdrop for the same patterns they refuse to change.*
