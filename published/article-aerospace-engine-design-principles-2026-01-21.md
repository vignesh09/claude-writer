Stand on a skateboard. Hold a fire extinguisher. Pull the trigger.

What happens next explains every aerospace engine ever built—from the Wright Flyer to the rockets landing on Mars.

The stream of gas shoots backward. You roll forward. That's it. That's the entire secret behind jet engines, rocket engines, and even the hypersonic scramjets that can hit Mach 9.6.

Most people think aerospace engines are impossibly complex machines only PhD engineers can understand. The truth? Every engine—whether it costs $2 million or $2 billion—works on a principle so simple you just demonstrated it with hardware store equipment.

This is the story of how that simple principle built an entire industry. And why understanding it doesn't require a degree in engineering—just curiosity about how things actually work.

## The Parallel Invention Nobody Talks About

In 1966, two elderly men met for the first time at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

For nearly 30 years, they'd been bitter rivals in a race that changed the world. Frank Whittle, a British RAF officer from a working-class family in Coventry. Hans von Ohain, a German physicist born into aristocratic affluence. Both had invented the jet engine. Neither had known the other existed until years after their breakthroughs.

The story of how they ended up in the same room—and why it mattered—reveals something important about aerospace engineering that textbooks miss.

**Frank Whittle's Journey**

Whittle was the son of an inventive mechanic who, despite lacking formal education, passed down an obsession with how things worked. In 1930, at age 23, Whittle filed a patent for the turbojet engine. The concept was radical: instead of propellers driven by pistons, use a turbine-driven compressor to create thrust directly.

The problem? Nobody would fund it.

For seven years, Whittle scraped together resources, working in his spare time while serving as an RAF pilot. On April 12, 1937, at the British Thomson-Houston factory, he cracked open a valve and sent fuel into the combustion chamber of his Whittle Unit (WU). The engine roared to life.

It worked. But the war was coming, and time was running short.

**Hans von Ohain's Parallel Path**

Across the English Channel, von Ohain was independently wrestling with the same problem. Unlike Whittle, von Ohain had something Whittle desperately lacked: corporate backing. Aircraft manufacturer Ernst Heinkel recognized the potential and funded development.

Here's where the story gets complicated.

Von Ohain's lawyer had given him a copy of Whittle's patents while his own application was being prepared—before he'd built a working engine. Whether von Ohain used those patents or arrived at his design independently became a point of bitter dispute.

What's not disputed: von Ohain's HeS 3 engine powered the Heinkel He 178 on August 27, 1939. It was the world's first turbojet-powered aircraft to fly. Whittle's engine wouldn't power a flight until 1941.

**The Reunion**

When Whittle first met von Ohain in 1966, he was furious. He'd believed for years that the German engineer had stolen his design. But as they talked—really talked—Whittle became convinced that von Ohain's work had been genuinely independent.

Two men, two countries on opposite sides of a war, solving the same problem with remarkably similar solutions. By 1991, they were standing together on stage accepting the Charles Stark Draper Prize, one of engineering's highest honors.

The lesson? Great ideas don't belong to individuals. They emerge when the conditions are right, regardless of who gets there first.

And both of those engines—British and German, rival designs separated by politics and war—worked on the exact same principle you demonstrated with that skateboard.

## Newton's Third Law: The Only Rule That Matters

"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

You've heard that since middle school physics. Here's what it actually means for aerospace engines:

**Push mass in one direction, and you move in the opposite direction.**

That's it. That's the entire foundation.

The fire extinguisher pushes gas backward. You roll forward. A jet engine pushes exhaust gases backward at incredible speed. The plane moves forward. A rocket engine does the same thing—just carries its own oxygen supply so it can work in the vacuum of space.

Every refinement, every innovation, every billion-dollar development program in aerospace history has been about doing this one thing more efficiently. Not inventing new physics. Not discovering secret principles. Just pushing mass out the back more cleverly.

Here's what surprised me when I started researching this: the fundamental principle hasn't changed in over a century. The Wright Brothers' first engine (1903), the jet engines that power modern airliners, and SpaceX's cutting-edge Raptor engines all work the same way.

**What has changed?** How efficiently we apply that principle. What materials we use. What fuels we burn. How we manage heat and pressure.

But Newton's Third Law? That's been the same since 1687.

## How Jet Engines Actually Work: Suck, Squeeze, Bang, Blow

If you've ever tried to explain how a jet engine works, you probably got lost in technical jargon about turbine stages and bypass ratios.

Here's a better way to remember it. Every jet engine in the sky right now is doing four things, in order:

**1. Suck**

Air enters the engine through a large intake at the front. This isn't passive—the engine is designed to pull in massive volumes of air. A typical commercial jet engine ingests about 1.25 tons of air per second at cruise.

That's roughly the weight of a car. Every second.

**2. Squeeze**

The compressor section (those rotating blades you see if you peer into the front of a jet engine) squeezes that air into a much smaller space. This dramatically raises both pressure and temperature.

Why does this matter? Compressed, hot air is easier to ignite and releases more energy when burned.

**3. Bang**

The combustor is where the fire happens. Fuel (typically a kerosene-based jet fuel) sprays into the compressed, heated air and ignites. This is continuous combustion—not the stop-and-start explosions of a car engine. The flame burns constantly, like a blowtorch.

The temperature in the combustion chamber can exceed 1,900°C (3,450°F)—hot enough to melt most metals. The chamber itself only survives because of carefully designed cooling channels and heat-resistant alloys.

**4. Blow**

Hot, high-pressure gases blast out of the combustion chamber and rush through the turbine section. This does two things:

- **Spins the turbine**, which drives the compressor at the front (the engine literally powers itself through this connection)
- **Creates thrust** as the remaining gases shoot out the back at high speed

That's the whole process. Suck, Squeeze, Bang, Blow. Repeat 30,000 times per minute.

**The Turbofan Twist**

Most modern commercial aircraft don't use pure turbojets anymore. They use turbofans—a variation that sends some air *around* the core engine instead of through it.

Why? Efficiency and noise reduction.

The large fan at the front of a turbofan engine (the huge spinning disc you see on a Boeing 777 or Airbus A350) moves a massive volume of air that never gets burned. This "bypass air" provides additional thrust while consuming less fuel and making less noise than forcing all that air through the combustion process.

It's the same basic principle—push mass backward—just applied more cleverly.

## The One Critical Difference: Where's Your Oxygen?

Here's the question that determines everything about engine design:

**Where does your oxygen come from?**

**Jet engines: Air breathers**

They suck oxygen from the atmosphere. This is brilliant for efficiency—you don't have to carry your oxidizer, so you can dedicate more weight to fuel and payload. The engine has two openings: an intake (for air) and an exhaust (for spent gases).

The limitation? You need air. At about 40,000 to 50,000 feet (12,000 to 15,000 meters), the atmosphere gets too thin for traditional jet engines to function efficiently. Above that, you need something else.

**Rocket engines: Bring your own**

Rockets carry both fuel and oxidizer (usually liquid oxygen). This makes them heavier and less efficient in the atmosphere, but it gives them a superpower: they work anywhere. Including the vacuum of space, where there's no air at all.

The engine has one opening: exhaust. Everything it needs is onboard.

This single difference—oxygen source—determines whether you can leave the planet or not.

## Evolution in Action: The Simplification Paradox

Here's something that surprised me: the most advanced rocket engines aren't necessarily more complex than their predecessors. Sometimes they're simpler.

**The Giant: Saturn V's F-1 Engine (1960s)**

The F-1 engine that powered NASA's Apollo missions to the Moon was an absolute monster:

- **Thrust**: ~700 tonnes per engine
- **Fuel**: RP-1 (refined kerosene) + liquid oxygen
- **Design philosophy**: Gas generator cycle—simpler but less efficient
- **Approach**: Make it BIG. Five massive engines lifted the entire Saturn V rocket.

Each F-1 stood 19 feet tall and weighed over 18,000 pounds. They were mechanical marvels of the 1960s—and they worked spectacularly.

**The Revolution: SpaceX's Raptor Engine (2019-2024)**

Fast-forward to SpaceX's Raptor engine, designed for Starship:

- **Raptor 1 (2019)**: 200 tonnes of thrust. Full-flow staged combustion cycle (only the third engine in history to use this highly efficient but complex design). Covered in sensors and plumbing.

- **Raptor 2 (2021)**: 230 tonnes of thrust—25% more powerful than Raptor 1. Simpler design. SpaceX engineers removed a significant amount of plumbing and sensors. The engine looked "borderline incomplete" compared to Raptor 1.

- **Raptor 3 (2024)**: 250+ tonnes of thrust. Even sleeker. More efficient. More durable.

**The Pattern**

In just five years, SpaceX evolved from complex to simple—and got better performance. Raptor 3 looks less complicated than Raptor 1 but outperforms it in every metric.

This is the simplification paradox: sometimes engineering progress means removing parts, not adding them.

Instead of five gigantic F-1 engines, Starship uses 31 smaller Raptor engines. Instead of one point of failure, you have redundancy. If one engine fails, you still have 30 others.

The philosophy shifted from "make it bigger" to "make it smarter."

**Why Methalox Matters**

Raptor also uses a different fuel: liquid methane (methalox) instead of kerosene. Why does this matter?

- **Cleaner burning**: Less carbon buildup (kerosene leaves residue that damages engines over time)
- **Easier to produce on Mars**: Methane can theoretically be manufactured from Martian atmospheric CO2 and subsurface ice
- **Better performance**: Higher specific impulse (efficiency) than kerosene

The choice of fuel isn't random. It's tied to the ultimate goal: reusability and eventual Mars colonization.

## The Speed Ladder: From Mach 0.85 to Mach 12

As you go faster, something interesting happens to engine design: it gets mechanically simpler but requires more sophisticated physics understanding.

**Turbofans: Commercial Flight (up to Mach 0.85)**

Your typical Boeing or Airbus uses a turbofan engine to cruise at about Mach 0.85 (567 mph / 913 km/h). These engines are optimized for fuel efficiency and noise reduction at subsonic speeds.

Trade-off: Great efficiency, but speed-limited. You can't push a turbofan much faster without running into compressibility problems and massive drag increases.

**Ramjets: High-Speed Missiles (Mach 3-5)**

At higher speeds, turbofan compressors become unnecessary. The vehicle's forward motion alone compresses incoming air sufficiently.

A ramjet has almost no moving parts. Air enters, slows down to subsonic speeds for combustion, burns, and exits. Simple. Efficient at high speed.

Trade-off: Ramjets can't work at low speeds. They need an initial boost (usually a rocket motor) to get up to operational velocity.

**Scramjets: Hypersonic Experimental (Mach 5-12+)**

Above Mach 5, even slowing the air to subsonic speeds creates too much drag and heat. The solution? Don't slow it down at all.

A scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) keeps the airflow supersonic throughout the entire engine. Air enters at Mach 5+, fuel mixes and burns while still moving faster than sound, and exhaust exits even faster.

This is absurdly difficult to achieve. You're trying to light and sustain a fire in a hurricane-force wind. But it works.

**Current Records and 2026 Developments**

- **NASA X-43A** (2004): Reached Mach 9.6—still the record for air-breathing engines
- **DRDO Scramjet Test** (January 9, 2026): Sustained scramjet operation for 12 minutes—a major milestone in endurance
- **Lockheed Martin & GE Aerospace** (2026): Demonstrating a liquid-fueled rotating detonation ramjet targeting Mach 5+ for extended-range missiles

**The Pattern**

- Turbofans: Complex machinery, moderate speed
- Ramjets: Simpler mechanics, high speed
- Scramjets: Almost no moving parts, hypersonic speed

The fastest engines have the least complexity *mechanically*. But they require deep understanding of supersonic aerodynamics, combustion physics, and thermal management.

Complexity shifts from mechanics to physics.

## What This All Means (And Why It Matters)

If you've read this far, you now understand something most people think is beyond their grasp: how aerospace engines actually work.

Not the intimidating technical details. The fundamental principles.

You know:

**1. The Universal Rule**

Every aerospace engine—jet, rocket, scramjet—works on Newton's Third Law. Push mass in one direction, move in the opposite direction. The fire extinguisher on a skateboard demonstrates the same physics as a $500 million rocket engine.

**2. The Critical Question**

Where does your oxygen come from? That single question determines whether you're building a jet (air-breathing) or a rocket (self-contained). And whether you can leave Earth's atmosphere.

**3. The Four-Step Process**

Jet engines Suck, Squeeze, Bang, and Blow. Understanding those four steps—and why each matters—demystifies the massive turbofans hanging from commercial airliners.

**4. The Simplification Paradox**

Advanced engineering isn't always about adding complexity. SpaceX's Raptor 3 is simpler than Raptor 1 but performs better. Scramjets have almost no moving parts yet achieve Mach 12. Sometimes progress means subtraction.

**5. The Speed-Complexity Relationship**

As speed increases, mechanical complexity decreases, but physics understanding must increase. The fastest engines are the simplest mechanically—they just require mastering supersonic combustion, which is fiendishly difficult.

## The Human Element

Remember Whittle and von Ohain—the rivals who became friends?

Their story reveals something important about innovation. Great ideas don't emerge from lone geniuses working in isolation. They emerge when conditions are right, when problems need solving, when smart people—sometimes on opposite sides of the world—start asking the same questions.

Whittle struggled for funding for seven years. Von Ohain had corporate backing from day one. Yet both arrived at fundamentally similar solutions.

The technology that changed the world didn't belong to either of them exclusively. It belonged to the moment when aviation needed to evolve beyond propellers, and two brilliant engineers—unknown to each other—both saw the path forward.

By 1991, they stood together accepting one of engineering's highest honors. The rivalry had dissolved into mutual respect.

Engineering isn't about winning races. It's about solving problems. And the best solutions often come from multiple people thinking hard about the same challenge.

## What To Do With This Knowledge

Next time you board a plane, pause before entering the jet bridge. Look at that massive turbofan hanging from the wing.

Remember: it's sucking in 1.25 tons of air per second. Compressing it. Burning it. Blasting it out the back 30,000 times per minute. All to push you forward using the same principle as a fire extinguisher on a skateboard.

You understand how it works now.

Next time you see a SpaceX launch, recognize that those Raptor engines represent a design philosophy shift—31 smaller engines instead of 5 massive ones. Simplification through iteration. Reusability through clever engineering.

And when you hear about hypersonic flight tests—scramjets hitting Mach 9.6 or new developments like the January 2026 DRDO test sustaining combustion for 12 minutes—you'll know why that's impressive. Keeping a fire lit in a supersonic wind is absurdly difficult. Yet we're getting better at it.

Aerospace engineering isn't a closed club for geniuses with PhDs. It's a field built on principles simple enough to explain with everyday objects.

The question isn't whether you *can* understand it.

The question is: what will you be curious about next?
