## Post Content

I set the same goal for five years in a row.

And failed every single time.

I blamed my discipline. I tried better systems. I downloaded more apps. I watched motivational videos telling me "if you have the power to set the goal, you have the power to achieve it."

Then I discovered something that changed everything:

The goal wasn't the problem. Setting the goal was.

Here's what the research shows:

92% of people fail to achieve their New Year's resolutions. Not because they lack motivation. Because goal-setting itself triggers your brain's threat response.

The gap between "who I am" and "who I want to be" creates cognitive dissonance. Your brain interprets that discomfort as danger and pushes you toward avoidance, not growth.

But here's what actually works:

Implementation intentions have a 91% success rate. That's not a typo.

The difference? Instead of "I want to exercise more," it's "I will exercise Monday at 6:30 AM at my local gym."

And deeper still: identity-based change.

Not "I want to write a book" but "I am a writer."

When writing becomes who you are, not something you're trying to do, missing a day isn't failure. It's just a temporary misalignment with your identity.

The irony? The best goals are the ones you forget. When identity and environment align, outcomes happen naturally.

What's a goal you've been chasing that might need a different approach entirely?
