## LINKEDIN POST:

The "stable" career path is now the riskiest one.

I spent six months researching whether uncertainty will increase. The data is overwhelming: 22% job market churn expected, technical skills obsolete every 2.5 years, entry-level white-collar jobs disappearing.

But here's what surprised me: I was asking the wrong question.

Trying to predict the future is like forecasting weather for next year's vacation. By the time you know if you're right, it doesn't matter.

The real question: How do I build a life that works regardless of what happens?

This led me to a concept I keep coming back to: the certainty tax.

It's the premium we pay to avoid uncertainty:

- "Stable" corporate jobs often pay 20-30% less than portfolio careers with equivalent total compensation
- Specialized degrees that lead to one path cost you 50-70% in optionality
- Predictable life in a high-cost city costs 40-60% in effective income vs. geographic flexibility

We're paying premiums for stability that doesn't exist anymore.

The employment contract promising "security" is increasingly worthless when companies restructure every 18 months. The degree promising career certainty is useless when skills obsolesce every 2.5 years.

Meanwhile, the "weird" careers - hard to categorize, illegible to HR systems, difficult to automate - are becoming safer.

If you can't easily define what someone does, you can't easily replace them.

What if you stopped paying the certainty tax?

Not because you predicted what would happen. But because you built a system that works regardless of what happens.

What's one area where you might be paying a premium for stability that doesn't actually exist?

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:

- **Optimal posting time:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 7:30-8:30 AM local time (catches morning commute scrollers and early work hours)
- **First-hour response plan:** Engage with every comment in the first 60 minutes. Ask follow-up questions to commenters who share their own experiences with the certainty tax
- **Expected engagement:** Comments will likely focus on personal examples of paying for false stability, questions about portfolio careers, and pushback on whether "weird" careers are actually safer
- **Follow-up content:** Post a follow-up comment after 2-3 hours with the "barbell strategy" framework from the full article - this adds value without requiring a new post

---

## PERFORMANCE METRICS TO TRACK:

- **Target engagement rate:** 3-5% (comments + shares relative to impressions)
- **Target reach:** 5-8x follower count within first 48 hours
- **Quality indicators:** Comments that share personal stories rather than generic agreement; saves/bookmarks indicate lasting value; shares indicate resonance with broader audience

## NOTES:

- Hook uses the "Counterintuitive Truth" pattern - challenges the assumption that stable = safe
- Personal fallibility shown through "I was asking the wrong question"
- Specific data points (22%, 2.5 years, 20-30%) add credibility without overwhelming
- Ends with engagement question that requires reflection, not just agreement
- Avoids being preachy - frames as "what if" rather than "you should"
- Character count: approximately 1,750 characters (within optimal 900-2,000 range for LinkedIn)
