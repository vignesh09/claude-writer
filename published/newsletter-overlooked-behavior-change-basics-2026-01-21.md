## PREVIEW TEXT

I built systems for my systems. The result surprised me...

## EMAIL BODY

---

I spent three years building the perfect habit system.

Color-coded spreadsheets. Habit tracking apps with streak counters. A morning routine so elaborate it required a checklist.

The result? I got really good at managing my failure.

Here's something I didn't want to admit: 92% of people who try to change their habits fail within three months. I was in that 92%, just with better documentation.

Then I looked at the research. And what I found felt almost insulting.

**The strategies with the strongest evidence base are the exact ones most people dismiss as "too basic."**

Environment design. Friction removal. Implementation intentions.

I'd heard of all of them. I'd dismissed all of them.

The 8% who actually succeed at behavior change? They're not using anything fancy. They're obsessively executing the boring fundamentals everyone else overlooks while searching for the perfect system.

Here's what surprised me most:

A meta-analysis of 94 studies found that implementation intentions - simple "if-then" plans - helped people complete difficult goals *three times* more often.

Three times.

The format is almost comically simple:
- "If I finish lunch, then I'll write for 10 minutes."
- "If I pour my morning coffee, then I'll take my vitamins."

No app. No tracking. No visible system.

So why did I resist this for three years?

Because complex systems feel like progress. Every color-coded cell, every data point - it all triggers the same dopamine response as actually changing. My brain couldn't tell the difference.

And complexity offers something seductive: something to blame when you fail.

"The system wasn't quite right."
"I need to tweak the approach."

Simple strategies offer no such escape. If you put your running shoes by the bed and still don't run, there's nowhere to hide.

That's uncomfortable. So we add complexity.

**The meta-insight I wish someone had told me:**

The search for the perfect behavior change system is itself a behavior pattern that needs changing.

Complexity is procrastination wearing a productivity costume.

What actually works for me now:

- Running shoes by the bed. (Environment design.)
- Social media apps deleted from my phone. (Strategic friction.)
- When I finish my morning coffee, I write for 20 minutes. (Implementation intention.)

That's it. Three tactics. None sophisticated.

But they work because I stopped treating "simple" as a problem to be solved.

**A challenge, if you're up for it:**

Pick ONE basic tactic. Not three. One.

Either:
1. Make one desired behavior visible and easy
2. Add friction to one bad habit (or remove it from a good one)
3. Create one "if-then" plan

Do it for 7 days without adding any complexity. No tracking app. No progress journal.

Just execute.

I suspect you already know what you need to do. The question is whether you'll let yourself believe the simple version is enough.

Hit reply and tell me: What's one "too simple" strategy you've been dismissing?
