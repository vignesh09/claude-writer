## LINKEDIN POST:

We don't have an AI infrastructure problem.

We have an organizational readiness crisis.

Big Tech is spending $600 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026. GPUs are sold out for months. Lead times stretch past 52 weeks. Everyone's talking about a compute shortage.

Here's what surprised me when I looked at the utilization data:

93% of companies can't achieve high GPU utilization even during peak periods. A MIT study found 95% of enterprise AI pilots delivered zero measurable return. Not low return. Zero.

And 42% of companies scrapped most of their AI initiatives last year--up from 17% the year before.

We've seen this exact pattern before.

When electric motors arrived in 1900, factories replaced their steam engines but kept the same layouts, same drive shafts, same workflows. Productivity didn't budge for 40 years--until a new generation of managers redesigned the entire factory floor around what electric motors actually made possible.

Computers showed the same pattern. Nobel laureate Robert Solow wrote in 1987: "We see computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics." The paradox lasted 15 years.

The common thread? Harvard Business Review found that 70% of challenges companies face rolling out AI are related to people and processes. Not GPUs. Not cloud infrastructure.

People and processes.

Yet the investment ratio is inverted. Infrastructure spending dominates while only 37% of companies invest meaningfully in change management or training.

Here's the uncomfortable part: developers using AI tools thought they were 20% faster. Controlled measurement showed they were actually 19% slower.

We're not just struggling with AI adoption. We're struggling to know we're struggling.

The infrastructure will matter eventually. Dark fiber from the dot-com era became the foundation for cloud computing a decade later. But the path from "we built it" to "we captured value" runs through "we redesigned how we work."

That middle step takes far longer than anyone wants to admit.

What's the real bottleneck at your organization--infrastructure availability or the capacity to actually change how people work?

## HASHTAGS:

#AIStrategy #FutureOfWork #DigitalTransformation #Leadership #EnterpriseAI

---

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:

- **Optimal posting time:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 7:30-8:30 AM local time (catches decision-makers and tech leaders during morning LinkedIn check)
- **First-hour response plan:** Engage with every comment in the first 60 minutes. Ask follow-up questions to commenters who share their own organizational bottleneck stories. Validate those who push back with nuance about real infrastructure needs.
- **Expected engagement:** Comments will likely split between (1) tech leaders confirming the organizational readiness problem from experience, (2) infrastructure vendors pushing back on the utilization framing, (3) requests for specifics on what "organizational transformation" actually looks like, and (4) people sharing their own "dark GPU" stories
- **Follow-up content:** Post a follow-up comment after 2-3 hours with the electrification analogy expanded--specifically Paul David's insight that it took a new generation of managers to reimagine the factory. This adds depth without requiring a new post.

---

## PERFORMANCE METRICS TO TRACK:

- **Target engagement rate:** 3-5% (comments + shares relative to impressions)
- **Target reach:** 5-10x follower count within first 48 hours
- **Quality indicators:** Comments sharing personal organizational transformation stories rather than generic agreement; saves/bookmarks indicate the historical parallels resonated; shares with added commentary from tech leaders signal authority building

## POST NOTES:

- Character count: approximately 1,950 characters (within optimal 1,300-2,000 range for LinkedIn visibility)
- Hook uses the "Counterintuitive Truth" pattern--challenges the assumption that AI's bottleneck is infrastructure
- Personal curiosity shown through "Here's what surprised me when I looked at the utilization data"
- Key data points: $600B spend, 93% underutilization, 95% zero ROI, 42% abandoned initiatives, 70% people/process challenges, 19% slower (not faster)
- Historical parallels (electrification, computers, dark fiber) compressed into credibility-building evidence
- The developer speed perception gap (thought 20% faster, actually 19% slower) serves as the post's most shareable insight
- Ends with a question that requires reflection and invites professional experience sharing
- Tone is curious and evidence-based, not doom-and-gloom or anti-AI
- Avoids telling people what to do; frames as "here's what I discovered" per voice guidelines
