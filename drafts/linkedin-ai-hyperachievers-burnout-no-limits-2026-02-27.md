## LINKEDIN POST (Short-Form):

The first people burning out from AI aren't the ones resisting it.

They're the ones who embraced it the most.

This surprised me. I assumed AI burnout would hit the overwhelmed -- people forced to adopt tools they didn't understand. But the data says the opposite.

Upwork surveyed 2,500 workers. Among those reporting the highest productivity gains from AI, 88% report experiencing burnout. They're twice as likely to consider quitting as people who haven't adopted AI at all.

Here's what I think is happening:

Before AI, ambitious people had natural constraints. Hiring took time. Projects required coordination. You physically couldn't do everything you imagined. Those bottlenecks were frustrating -- but they were also sending a signal: "You've done enough for today."

AI removed the bottlenecks. But it didn't remove the ambition.

In 1865, economist William Jevons noticed that more fuel-efficient steam engines didn't reduce coal consumption. They increased it -- because efficiency made coal viable for more applications.

AI has done the same thing to human attention.

The friction wasn't just slowing you down. Some of it was protecting you.

What's your experience been? Has AI given you more capacity -- or just more things to fill it with?

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:

- **Optimal posting time:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 7:30-8:30 AM local time (targets founders, tech leaders, and ambitious professionals during morning scroll)
- **First-hour response plan:** Engage with every comment in the first 60 minutes. Ask follow-up questions to people sharing their own AI adoption experience. Validate both the "AI has been incredible" and "AI is exhausting me" perspectives -- the point is that both can be true simultaneously. Avoid being anti-AI; keep the frame as a nuanced observation.
- **Expected engagement:** Comments will likely split between (1) hyper-achievers confirming the "more capacity, not more time" feeling, (2) founders and builders sharing how AI expanded their scope beyond what was healthy, (3) pushback from people who feel AI has genuinely improved their work-life balance, and (4) requests for practical advice on setting limits
- **Follow-up content:** Post a follow-up comment after 2-3 hours sharing the University of Toronto finding about friction being essential for psychological well-being. This deepens the argument without front-loading too much research. Also mention the Hieu Pham resignation as a timely example if the conversation moves toward tech culture specifically.

---

## PERFORMANCE METRICS TO TRACK:

- **Target engagement rate:** 4-6% (the personal vulnerability angle and counterintuitive framing should drive higher comment rates than typical thought leadership)
- **Target reach:** 5-10x follower count within first 48 hours
- **Quality indicators:** Comments sharing personal burnout stories rather than generic agreement; saves/bookmarks indicate the Jevons Paradox framework resonated; shares with added commentary from founders and tech leaders signal the insight hit close to home

## POST NOTES:

- Character count: approximately 1,400 characters (within optimal range for LinkedIn feed visibility)
- Hook uses the "Counterintuitive Truth" pattern -- challenges the assumption that AI burnout hits resistors, not enthusiasts
- Curiosity shown through "This surprised me" framing per voice guidelines
- Key data point (88% burnout among highest productivity gainers) is the most shareable stat -- specific, surprising, and backed by a named source
- Jevons Paradox gives readers a mental model to explain their own experience, which increases shareability
- Ends with an open question that invites personal reflection, not a yes/no answer
- Tone is curious and evidence-based, not anti-AI or fear-based
- Avoids telling people what to do; frames as "here's what I noticed" per voice guidelines
- Deliberately holds back some research (University of Toronto, Hieu Pham) for comment engagement rather than overloading the main post

## LINKEDIN ARTICLE (Long-Form):

# The Friction That Was Protecting You: Why AI Is Burning Out the People Who Embrace It Most

I used to think hyper-achievers had one real problem: not enough capacity to match their ambition.

The to-do list always outgrew the hours. The ideas always outnumbered the hands. The vision was vivid, but execution was the bottleneck.

Then AI arrived, and for a certain type of person -- the driven, the ambitious, the people already operating at the edge -- it felt like a miracle. Finally, the capacity to match the ambition. Finally, no ceiling.

What happened next surprised me.

## The Enthusiasts Are Burning Out First

The first people burning out from AI are not the reluctant adopters. They are the enthusiasts. The ones who shipped the most. Built the most. Loved what they were doing.

Right up until they couldn't anymore.

Upwork surveyed 2,500 workers in 2024. Among those reporting the highest productivity gains from AI:

-> 88% report experiencing burnout
-> They are twice as likely to consider quitting as non-adopters

Quantum Workplace found frequent AI users experience 45% higher burnout rates than infrequent users.

And UC Berkeley research published in HBR this month confirmed something uncomfortable: workers voluntarily using AI extended work into more hours and took on broader task ranges -- without being asked.

As the researchers put it: "You had thought that maybe, 'Oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less.' But then really, you don't work less. You just work the same amount or even more."

The people who leaned in hardest got hit hardest. That's not what anyone predicted.

## The Jevons Paradox for Human Attention

In 1865, economist William Stanley Jevons observed something counterintuitive about steam engines. As they became more fuel-efficient, coal consumption didn't drop. It skyrocketed -- because efficiency made coal viable for applications nobody had considered before.

AI has done the same thing to human attention.

When knowledge work becomes faster and cheaper, the response is not to do fewer things. It's to do exponentially more of them.

For hyper-achievers, this runs at maximum intensity. The ambition was always infinite. The bottlenecks were finite. AI removed the bottlenecks.

Before AI, a founder who wanted to build 12 products had to hire, manage, wait on contractors -- and accept failure as a signal. These constraints were the mechanism by which ambitious humans received the message: "You've done enough."

With AI, that signal disappeared. The to-do list no longer has a natural endpoint. Every idea is now buildable. Every project is now feasible. Every ambition is now reachable -- at least in theory.

In practice, the human running all of it still has the same 24 hours, the same nervous system, the same need for recovery.

## The Friction Was Never Just Inefficiency

Here's the part that took me the longest to accept.

The friction AI removes was never just wasted time. Some of it was protection.

University of Toronto researchers published findings this year in Communications Psychology: "The very friction AI removes -- the effort, struggle, and difficulty essential to human growth -- may be critical for psychological well-being."

The slow parts of work weren't all waste. Some of them were:

-> Recovery time disguised as process
-> Natural stopping points that prevented overextension
-> Cognitive buffers between intense tasks
-> Built-in reflection periods during waiting

When you eliminate all the "inefficiency," you also eliminate the breathing room that was keeping people functional.

AI didn't give hyper-achievers more time. It gave them more capacity.

Those are not the same thing.

More time means the same workload fits into fewer hours, leaving space for rest. More capacity means the workload expands to consume everything available -- and then some.

## The Human Cost Is Already Here

This is not a theoretical risk.

On February 26, 2026, Hieu Pham -- former OpenAI technical staff, previously at xAI and Google Brain -- resigned citing severe burnout. He had previously dismissed mental health concerns in tech culture.

His statement was striking in its honesty: "I am burnt out. All the mental health deteriorating that I used to scoff at is real, miserable, scary, and dangerous."

The person who thought burnout wouldn't happen to him. The one who was too driven, too committed, too capable. That's exactly the profile most at risk.

---

## The Counterintuitive Truth

Here's what I'm wrestling with now.

The most productive thing a hyper-achiever can do with AI might not be finding a more efficient workflow. It might be figuring out what "enough" looks like -- and then actually stopping there.

Not because ambition is bad. But because the constraints that used to force stopping points have been removed, and nothing has replaced them.

The friction wasn't holding you back. Some of it was holding you together.

I don't have a clean framework for this yet. I'm not sure anyone does. But I do know the conversation has shifted from "How do we get people to adopt AI faster?" to something harder and more important.

How do we make sure the people who embrace it the most don't lose themselves in the process?

What's your experience been -- has AI expanded what you can do, or expanded what you feel you should do?

## ARTICLE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:

- **Optimal posting time:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8:00-9:00 AM local time (LinkedIn articles perform well slightly later than feed posts, catching professionals settling into their workday)
- **Companion post:** Share the article with the short-form post above as the teaser. The post drives clicks to the article for the full argument.
- **Expected engagement:** Article comments tend to be longer and more thoughtful. Expect (1) tech leaders sharing personal burnout stories, (2) founders reflecting on how AI changed their relationship to work, (3) HR/people leaders connecting this to organizational wellness, (4) debate about whether "friction as protection" is a valid frame or just resistance to change
- **Follow-up content:** Publish a follow-up short post 2-3 days later with the question: "If AI removed all your bottlenecks tomorrow, what would actually stop you from working 18-hour days?" This extends the conversation and drives return traffic to the original article.

## ARTICLE NOTES:

- Word count: approximately 900 words (within the 800-1,200 target for LinkedIn articles)
- Structure follows the source article's argument arc but adapted for LinkedIn's professional audience
- Opens with personal vulnerability ("I used to think...") matching established voice patterns
- Each section has a clear, scannable heading for readers who skim before committing
- The Jevons Paradox framework is the anchor concept -- gives readers a mental model they can reference and share
- University of Toronto and Hieu Pham details provide both academic rigor and human immediacy
- Closing uses "Here's what I'm wrestling with" instead of prescriptive advice, maintaining the curious-not-preachy voice
- Two engagement questions at the end -- one reflective, one slightly challenging -- to drive different types of comments
- The distinction between "more time" vs "more capacity" is the article's most original framing and likely most quotable line
- Arrow formatting (->) used for lists per voice guidelines rather than bullet points
- Deliberately avoids being anti-AI; positions the insight as a nuance that enthusiasts need, not a reason to resist adoption
